## Overview

This page collects some websites that I visit frequently, especially for keeping track of new papers and useful mathematical resources.  
I will update this page from time to time as I discover more helpful links.

## 1. Daily arXiv updates (AI-enhanced)

I use the following two pages to follow new papers on arXiv in my main research areas.  

They are built by forking and modifying the GitHub project [daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced](https://github.com/dw-dengwei/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced).

Both pages automatically fetch the **new, cross-list, and replacement** submissions and use the DeepSeek model to generate short Chinese summaries from the abstracts.


- 🔗 [Daily arXiv—Representation Theory (math.RT)](https://leemath-lzu.github.io/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced-RT/)  
  This page focuses on representation theory (math.RT) and provides AI-generated Chinese summaries based on the abstracts for quick daily reading.

- 🔗 [Daily arXiv—Quantum Algebra (math.QA)](https://leemath-lzu.github.io/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced-QA/)  
  This page focuses on quantum algebra (math.QA) and provides AI-generated Chinese summaries based on the abstracts for quick daily reading.
